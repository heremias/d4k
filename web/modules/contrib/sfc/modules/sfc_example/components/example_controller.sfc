<!--
  Components can be rendered in routes using a controller provided by SFC. This
  component is available at /hello/{name}, but isn't explicitly aware of its
  use as a page. To render the bare component, which is useful with AJAX,
  append the "?_sfc_raw=1" query string.

  See ../sfc_example.routing.yml for the implementation details.
